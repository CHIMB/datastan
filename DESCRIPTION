Title: Minimizing Linkage Response Time with User Friendly Standardizing Functions and Applications
Version: 0.3.1
Author: Cole Chuchmach [aut, cre]

Description: The automatic data standardization package is meant to help minimize the time data analysts spend
    on manually cleaning and processing the data for linkage. How this package helps is by using an SQLite metadata
    file to store information on how to specifically process certain fields from a source fields. To upkeep this data
    the user is provided with an application that allows changes of any size to be made to datasets that may change on
    a annual or monthly basis, keeping it all in one location such that the user will not be required to make changes
    to any processing code, only the metadata information.
